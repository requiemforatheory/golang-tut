# R4AT Golang Tutorial Lesson 1
### *Setting up your environment & hello world.*
##### ***ndarwincorn***

Welcome to the start of R4AT's Golang tutorial. In this lesson, we'll start by covering setting up your computer for Go development and running a couple tests to ensure that we've done everything correctly. Right now we're operating under the unlikely assumption that you're running Arch Linux and want to use Github's Atom as your text editor, future editions will address that. Accompanying exercises will reinforce the concepts discussed here.

### 1.1.1 Overview
If you're comfortable in your operating system's package manager, setting environmental variables for both GUI and CLI, you can probably just read this overview and skip the following sections specific to your given OS and text editor. Installing and configuring Go is a pretty simple process, accomplished in just a few steps:

1. Install the Go package (or golang, depending on your OS) with your package manager. If using Windows, install the golang MSI from [golang.org](https://golang.org).
2. Create a $GOPATH environmental variable, pointing by convention at $HOME/go.
3. Add $GOPATH/bin to your $PATH environmental variable.

If that's insufficient instruction for you, find your preferred OS and text editor below and read on.
